# Workout Logger Example

## Install Dependencies

Run `npm install` to install all dependencies.

✨ **This workspace has been generated by [Nx, Smart Monorepos · Fast CI.](https://nx.dev)** ✨

## Start the application

Run `npx nx storybook workout-logger-example` to start the development server. As I have a mock API that only works in development mode, this is currently the only option to run the solution.

## Start storybook

Run `npx nx build workout-logger-example` to start Storybook. This is a quick way to see and test individual components.

## Design Decisions

Here are some key decisions, tools used and why things were done the way they are:
- The project was created using [Nx](https://nx.dev/). My main experience with Nx is on the Angular side, but I like the way they have consistent patterns and configuration funtionality.
- Rather than build everything from scratch, I chose a few components to use. Once an overall UX design approach is made, I prefer to get components that match that design (e.g. if the UX design in Material, I would choose all Material-based components).
- The data grid is [ag-grid](https://ag-grid.com/). It includes sorting functionality and some cool animations.
- The forms are based on [react-hook-form](https://react-hook-form.com/).
- Several components (e.g. buttons, dialogs, etc.) use the Material UI version of [MUI Code](https://mui.com/). This was to prevent the need to style everything from scratch (and wouldn't be necessary if using Bootstrap, Tailwind, etc.).
- The date picker is [react-datepicker](https://github.com/Hacker0x01/react-datepicker).
- State Management is done via the [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/). Most of this 
- Mock API functionality is done using [Mock Service Worker](https://github.com/mswjs/msw). Note that using the browser refresh causes the exercises to be recreated and doesn't save any changes you have made.

## What Would I Do Next

If this was a full project, here are some things I would look to do next:
- Error handling around API calls, loading spinners, etc. With a mock API, there is no need for much of this stuff, but there are plenty of errors in the real world.
- Break down components more granularly. I love the [Atomic Design](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/) approach. Many of the components are too big right now and could be broken down better.
- Create consistent styles, color theme, overall design pattern. This could be implementation of Bootstrap, Material Design, Tailwind, etc.
- Add testing. This could be Jest for component testing and Cypress for integration testing. One of both could be used depending on needs and requirements.
- Break out Exercise Type into an enum or something else to properly type the field. Ideally, logic to help programmatically determine whether the duration field is available for editing should be included. This logic is currently hardcoded in a couple of places.
